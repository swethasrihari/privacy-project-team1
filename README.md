# Privacy Analysis of Wearable Health Devices

In this project we are going to compare two wearable health devices, check their data collection process, analyse the data collected to answer some questions such as :
*) Have they followed data minimization techniques while collecting data?
*) Is the data which has been collected de identified/ anonymized?
 
 And finally try to apply differential privacy.
